# Diabetes Challenge

After we learned some interesting algorithms to solve classification problems, it's time to implement them on new data and to compare their performance. You can find today's challenge in the diabetes notebook.


## Environment

Use the requirements file in this repo to create a new virtual environment for this task.


```BASH
pyenv local 3.11.3 
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you are working on Windows type the following commands in the PowerShell:

```sh
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
